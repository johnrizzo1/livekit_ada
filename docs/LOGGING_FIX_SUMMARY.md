# Logging and ChatContext Fix Summary

## Problem
The LiveKit multiprocessing framework tries to pickle log records containing coroutine objects, resulting in thousands of "TypeError: cannot pickle 'coroutine' object" errors that flood the console and make debugging impossible.

## Solutions Created

### 1. Python Wrapper Script (Recommended)
**File:** `run_ada.py`

```bash
python run_ada.py test-room
```

Features:
- Filters out all pickle-related logging errors using regex patterns
- Preserves important debug messages
- Shows clean startup banner
- Handles graceful shutdown
- Tracks error blocks to filter multi-line stack traces

### 2. Shell Script
**File:** `scripts/run_agent_clean.sh`

```bash
./scripts/run_agent_clean.sh test-room
```

Uses grep to filter out error patterns but less comprehensive than Python wrapper.

### 3. Agent Logging Configuration
**Modified:** `scripts/ada_agent.py`

Added:
- Disabled `livekit.agents.ipc` logger entirely
- Set appropriate log levels for noisy loggers
- Force logging reconfiguration

### 4. Documentation
**File:** `docs/DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md`

Updated with:
- Instructions for using the clean runners
- Details about the audio issue (TTS generates audio but client receives silence)
- Environment variable configuration
- Quick test commands

## Usage

To test the agent with clean logging:

```bash
# Make wrapper executable
chmod +x run_ada.py

# Run with clean output
python run_ada.py test-room
```

Now you can see the actual logs and debug why audio is being transmitted as silence despite TTS generating valid audio (RMS: 4697).

## ChatContext API Fix

### Problem
The code was using the old LiveKit API where `ChatContext` had a `messages` attribute:
```python
chat_ctx = agent_llm.ChatContext()
chat_ctx.messages.extend(chat_messages)  # AttributeError: 'ChatContext' object has no attribute 'messages'
```

### Solution
Fixed to use the new API where `ChatContext` is initialized with messages:
```python
chat_ctx = agent_llm.ChatContext(chat_messages)  # Correct API usage
```

Also updated the debug logging to use `chat_ctx.items` instead of `chat_ctx.messages`.

## Next Steps

With clean logging and the ChatContext fix, you can now:
1. Test the agent without LLM errors
2. Monitor the audio pipeline to see where audio is lost
3. Check if audio frames are being sent to the room
4. Verify the audio track is properly published
5. Debug the transmission issue
