# Audio Playback Speed Fix Summary

## Problem
The agent's TTS audio was playing very slowly, as if each word was being dragged out.

## Root Cause
Sample rate mismatch - Piper was outputting audio at one sample rate (varies by model, often 22050Hz or 16000Hz), but we were assuming a fixed rate of 16000Hz.

## Solution
Added automatic sample rate detection and resampling in `src/local_tts.py`:

1. **Detection**: When Piper generates audio, we now read the actual sample rate from the WAV file
2. **Resampling**: If the rate doesn't match LiveKit's expected 16kHz, we resample using scipy
3. **Logging**: Added info logging to show when resampling occurs

## Key Changes
- Modified `LocalPiperTTS._synthesize_sync()` to detect actual sample rate
- Added `_resample_audio()` method using scipy for high-quality resampling
- Updated all sample rate comments to clarify LiveKit expects 16kHz

## Testing
Use these scripts to verify the fix:
- `test_piper_direct.py` - Test Piper TTS directly
- `test_resampling.py` - Test TTS with automatic resampling
- `test_with_audio_playback.py` - Full test with microphone and speakers
- `test_full_interaction.sh` - Complete voice interaction test

## Result
Audio now plays at normal speed, enabling natural voice conversations with the local agent.
