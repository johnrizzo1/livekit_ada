# Product Context: Ada Voice Agent

## Why This Project Exists

### Problem Statement
Most voice AI solutions require cloud services, creating privacy concerns, latency issues, and internet dependencies. Users need a fully local voice AI agent that can have natural conversations without external dependencies.

### Target Use Cases
- **Private Conversations**: Sensitive discussions requiring complete data privacy
- **Offline Environments**: Areas with poor or no internet connectivity
- **Developer Platform**: Foundation for building custom voice AI applications
- **Research & Learning**: Understanding voice AI pipelines without black-box services

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow
1. **Agent Startup**: Ada joins a LiveKit room and waits for participants
2. **Voice Detection**: System detects when user starts speaking
3. **Speech Processing**: Local Whisper converts speech to text
4. **AI Response**: Local Ollama LLM generates conversational response
5. **Voice Synthesis**: Local Piper TTS converts response to speech
6. **Audio Delivery**: System plays response through LiveKit audio

### Key Experience Goals
- **Natural Conversation**: Feels like talking to a human assistant
- **Low Latency**: Sub-second response times for fluid interaction
- **Reliable Turn-Taking**: Clear indication of when agent is listening vs speaking
- **High Audio Quality**: Clear, natural-sounding speech synthesis
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time status indicators for debugging and monitoring

## User Personas

### Primary: Developer/Researcher
- Building voice AI applications
- Values privacy and local control
- Needs debugging and monitoring capabilities
- Comfortable with technical setup

### Secondary: Privacy-Conscious User
- Wants voice AI without cloud dependencies
- Values data sovereignty
- Needs reliable offline operation
- Less technical, wants simple setup

## Success Metrics
- **Latency**: Voice-to-voice response < 1 second
- **Accuracy**: STT transcription accuracy > 95%
- **Quality**: Natural-sounding TTS output
- **Reliability**: Stable operation for extended conversations
- **Privacy**: Zero external network calls during operation

## Value Proposition
"A complete voice AI assistant that runs entirely on your local hardware, providing private, low-latency conversations without any cloud dependencies or internet requirements."

This positions Ada as the go-to solution for developers and users who prioritize privacy and local control over their voice AI interactions.
