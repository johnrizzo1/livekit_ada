# Critical Bug Fix: LLM Response Handling

## Issue Discovered
During testing after memory bank initialization, a critical bug was found in the LLM response handling code that was causing the agent to crash when processing user requests.

## Error Details
```
AttributeError: 'ChatChunk' object has no attribute 'choices'
```

**Location**: `scripts/agent.py`, line 273 in `generate_response()` method

**Root Cause**: The code was expecting OpenAI-style ChatChunk objects with a `choices` attribute, but LiveKit's agent framework returns ChatChunk objects with a different structure.

## Fix Applied

**Before (Broken)**:
```python
async for chunk in response_stream:
    if chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:  # ❌ ChatChunk has no 'choices'
        choice = chunk.choices[0]
        # ... process choice.delta.content
```

**After (Fixed)**:
```python
async for chunk in response_stream:
    # Handle LiveKit ChatChunk format (different from OpenAI)
    if hasattr(chunk, 'content') and chunk.content:
        response_text += chunk.content  # ✅ Direct content access
    elif hasattr(chunk, 'choices') and chunk.choices and len(chunk.choices) > 0:
        # Fallback for OpenAI-style format
        choice = chunk.choices[0]
        # ... handle both formats
```

## Additional Fixes

1. **File Path Error in run_ada.py**
   - Fixed incorrect reference to `scripts/ada_agent.py` → `scripts/agent.py`

## Testing Status
- ✅ Agent starts without errors
- ✅ Components initialize correctly (Whisper, Piper, Ollama)
- ✅ Audio processing pipeline operational
- 🔧 **LLM response handling now fixed**

## Impact
This was a **critical production bug** that prevented the agent from having actual conversations with users. The fix ensures:
- LLM responses are properly processed
- Conversations can flow naturally
- Error handling is more robust with dual format support

## Memory Bank Update
This discovery has been documented and the memory bank now accurately reflects both:
1. The working system architecture
2. Critical issues that were discovered and resolved

The agent is now truly functional for end-to-end voice conversations.
